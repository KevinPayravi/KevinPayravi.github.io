					<h3>Work Experience</h3>

						<h4>Hyland, creator of OnBase</h4>
						<i>Intern, Healthcare Services</i> (June 2015 – Present)
						<p class="indented">
							Starting as an intern in Hyland's Healthcare Services department in Summer 2015, I developed an internal reporting tool that generates a navigable website of project and employee data.
							Powered by SQL, VBScript, and Excel, the reports are actively used by the department to quickly get project statuses, identify issues, plan future allocations, and view employee utilization.
							The reports have been since used by management for better project management, resulting in time savings and better employee scheduling.
							<br>
							Throughout the academic year, I continued to support the project part-time while working remotely at school.
							<br>
							Come Summer 2016, I returned to Hyland. I continued to expand and improve the reporting project, and expanded its feature set to include auto-generating newsletter integrated with Outlook.
						</p>
						
						<br>
						
						<h4>Taazaa Inc.</h4>
						<i>Intern, Web Development & Community Manager</i> (Summer 2014)
						<p class="indented">

							In 2015, I served as co-lead on OHI/O's web and branding teams. Being part of the web team involved developing the hackathon's website and providing for internal tools for the team to use. Branding involved coming up with the visual identity and brand of both OHI/O and the event. The event went well, doubling in attendance compared to 2014! 
							In 2016, I continued those roles as a lead, and have also started contributing to establishing company relations. 
							Working with a fantastic and passionate goup of students and staff, OHI/O has provided a great opportunity for me to give back to the community and help foster a tech culture that I'm very passionate about.
